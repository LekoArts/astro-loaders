# Astro Flickr loader

This package provides multiple [Flickr](https://flickr.com/) content loaders for Astro's [content layer](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/). Most loaders correspond to a single Flickr API endpoint, however some loaders call multiple one for better results. The data returned from Flickr is normalized and cleaned up, so that each loader's response is similar and easy to work with.

## Prerequisites

- Astro 5 or later installed
- A Flickr API key
  - Create an account on Flickr, go to [App Garden](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/) to register an app, and copy the `Key`

## Installation

```shell
npm install @lekoarts/flickr-loader
```

## Usage

Import `@lekoarts/flickr-loader` into `src/content.config.ts` and define your collections. You can import various loaders that correspond to their respective Flickr API endpoints.

**Important:** You need to either define the Flickr API key as an environment variable (`FLICKR_API_KEY`) or pass it to every loader with the `api_key` argument.
